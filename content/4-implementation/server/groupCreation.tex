\subsection{Group creation}\label{sec:implServerGroupCreation}
When a new group is created with the application the server API endpoint \textit{.../api/groups/create} is called, which is a HTTPs POST request \cite{POSTHTTPMDN} endpoint.
\Cref{fig:serverNewGroupFlowChart} presents the flow chart when a new group is creates.

\fig{New group creation flow chart}{serverNewGroupFlowChart}{1.0}{flowCharts/serverNewGroup}

\subsubsection{Data preparation}\label{sec:implServerGroupCreationDataPrep}
Since the server takes care of the group creation against the Azure Cosmos Database \cite{IntroductionAzureCosmos} the ID is not created by the application.
A \acrfull{uuid} \cite{CommonsIdUUID} is created by the server when the API endpoint mentioned above is called.

\subsubsection{Fingerprint processing}\label{sec:implServerGroupCreationFingerprint}
\fig{Format of group fingerprint}{fingerprintIllustration}{0.4}{fingerprintIllustration}

In the iBeacon data that comes from the application the data it not formatted in the right way, and looks like the example presented in \Cref{listing:unformattedBeaconData}.
For the data to take the form as presented in \Cref{fig:fingerprintIllustration} the data need to be sorted and cleaned.

\fileListing{Unformatted iBeacon data from application}{unformattedBeaconData}{json}{fingerprint.json}

Only the minor value from the strongest iBeacon is saved together with the top three strongest \acrshort{rssi} values. After this operation a single fingerprint looks like \cref{listing:singleFingerprint}.

\fileListing{Single fingerprint after cleaning and sorting}{singleFingerprint}{json}{singleFormatedFingerprint.json}

In the sorting operation each iBeacon data object is inserted in a fingerprint array with the form presented in \Cref{listing:singleFingerprint} above.
When all the data is processed the array looks like \Cref{listing:multipleFingerprints} below.

\fileListing{Multiple processed fingerprints to be stored in the new group}{multipleFingerprints}{json}{multipleFormatedFingerprints.json}


\subsubsection{Database}\label{sec:implServerGroupCreationDatabase}
When all data is being prepared and processed it's inserted into the Azure Cosmos Database as a new record.
How the data is formatted when it's being sent to the server see appendix \ref{appendix:newGroupData}.
