\subsection{Application functionalities}\label{sec:implAppPartsFunc}
Together with the parts in the applications presented in \cref{sec:implAppParts} the different functionalities has been implemented to fulfil goal \ref{goal:poc} in \cref{sec:introGoals}.
The application consists of two major parts, set a location to retrieve a set of machines from the server and to create a new group.
In this sub-section the implementation of these two parts is being described.

\subsubsection{Display machines for set position}\label{sec:implAppFuncMachines}
\subsubsection{Create a new group}\label{sec:implAppFuncGroup}
