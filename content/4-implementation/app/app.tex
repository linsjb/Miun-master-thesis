\section{Apple iOS application}\label{sec:implApp}
The Apple iOS application was developed in the native iOS platform language Swift, made by Apple \cite{SwiftOrg}.
% A design overview of the application data flow can be seen in \cref{fig:appDesign}.
% The following sub-sections describes the different parts in the application and its functions related to \cref{fig:appDesign}.
To meet requirements \ref{req:createGroups}, \ref{req:positionDevice} and \ref{req:displayData} presented in appendix \ref{appendix:requirements} the application has two main parts.
First is the implementation of how a new group is created followed by the implementation of how to position a device and display the position data.
