In the literature review presented in \cref{sec:theoryRelatedWork} it was showed that  all papers, which implemented an \acrfull{ips}, has no clear method but was all following the same structure.
They all started with a problem formulation followed by the software design, implementation, testing and finally an evaluation.
Software project does often use this kind of structure, and since the method was being used in those papers presented in \cref{sec:theoryRelatedWork} a similar method structure was used in this thesis project.

\bigskip

A method framework that is well-defined is presented in the paper \textit{Secrets of successful simulation projects} \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995}.
The paper describes how a simulation based project should be performed for a successful result.
This thesis project is not a simulation project, but the proposed method framework can still verify that the method structure in this thesis is relevant.
