\section{Research analysis and problem definition}\label{sec:methodProblemDefinition}
% In the method framework by S. Robinson et al. in the paper \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} a problem definition is the first phase.
% The problem is being identified, experimental inputs and outputs is being defined, the scope and level of the project is being determined and a project specification is provided.
% To be able to make a strong foundation S.Robinson et al. mentions that a clear set of objectives is an important part. 
% Without this a project will almost never succeed.

% \bigskip

% The authors also mentions that discussions with the customer of the project is important and needed to develop a deep understanding of the system to be modelled.
% They also says that it's important to know the experimental factors and reports for the project.
% With this being set and decided it's easier to give the right inputs so the resulting outputs is expected.
% When it comes to determine the scope and level of the model it tells what elements that's required for the model, where the scope is telling what should be included and the level tells the details.

% \bigskip

% S. Robinson et al. also mention the importance to get the right type of data to succeed with the model. 
% A well written project specification is also important since this will tell if the problem is understood by all involved parties.

To fulfil goal \ref{goal:fieldInvestigation} and \ref{goal:systemDesign} presented in \cref{sec:introGoals} a problem definition, in form of a case study, and a research analysis was performed.

\subsection{Problem definition}\label{sec:methodProblemDefinition}
To succeed with a project a clear understanding of the problem is a large factor.
Discussions with the customer is therefore important to create a deep understanding of the problem.
Without this knowledge a project will almost always fail.

This project was faced towards the company LKAB and their positioning problem mentioned in \cref{sec:introOverallAim} and \ref{sec:introProblemStatement}.
Meetings was conducted with the company to fully know what they wanted to solve.
This resulted in a requirements specification which can be seen in appendix \ref{appendix:requirements}.

\subsection{Research analysis}\label{sec:methodResearchAnalysis}
The research analysis was performed as a literature review. 
This resulted in knowledge how to implement a \acrshort{ips} and what techniques being used in previous research.
\Cref{sec:theoryRelatedWork} presents the results from the literature review.
