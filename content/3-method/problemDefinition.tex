\section{Research analysis and problem definition}\label{sec:methodProblemDefinition}
To be able to know what to do and how to do it a case study and a research analysis was performed.
These are being described in this sub-section.


\subsection{Research analysis}\label{sec:}
The research analysis was performed as a literature review. 
This resulted in knowledge how to implement a \acrlong{ips} and what techniques previous research done in the area.
\Cref{sec:theoryRelatedWork} presents the result of this literature review.


\subsection{Problem formulation and definition}\label{sec:}
As S. Ribonson et al. mentions in the paper \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} a clear understanding of the problem that a project will solve is crucial, without this the project will almost always fail.
With this in mind a great deal of emphasis was places on this to fully understand the problem and what the customer with this work.
From this the foundation of the thesis could be set, which is being presented in \cref{sec:introOverallAim} and \ref{sec:introProblemStatement}.
