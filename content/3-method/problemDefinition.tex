\section{Research analysis and problem definition}\label{sec:methodProblemDefinition}
To be able to fulfil goal \ref{goal:posInvestigation} in \cref{sec:introGoals} a problem definition, in form of a case study, and a research analysis was performed.
This is the first part of the method framework (see \cref{fig:methodOverview}) which is based on \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995}.


\subsection{Problem formulation and definition}\label{sec:}
As S. Ribonson et al. mentions in the paper \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} a clear understanding of the problem that a project will solve is crucial, without this the project will almost always fail.
With this in mind a great deal of emphasis was places on this to fully understand the problem and what the customer wanted with this work.
From this the foundation of the thesis could be set, which is being presented in \cref{sec:introOverallAim} and \ref{sec:introProblemStatement}.


\subsection{Research analysis}\label{sec:}
The research analysis was performed as a literature review. 
This resulted in knowledge how to implement a \acrfull{ips} and what techniques being used in previous research.
\Cref{sec:theoryRelatedWork} presents the result of this literature review.
