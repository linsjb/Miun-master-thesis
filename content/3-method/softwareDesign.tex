\section{Software design}\label{sec:methodSoftwareDesign}
Although software design is a iterative process that can change over time it's  an important step, as mentioned by xx in...
Just as S. Robinson et al. mentions in \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} it's beneficial to first design the software before implementing it.
\bigskip

So to fulfil goal \ref{goal:poc} in \cref{sec:introGoals} and to follow the presented method framework (see \cref{fig:methodOverview}) the software implementation started with a software design.

\bigskip

The software was designed from the accumulated knowledge based on the research analysis performed in \cref{sec:methodProblemDefinition} and is here being motivated.
