\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:methodEvaluation}
In the method framework presented by S. Ribonson et al. in \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} the third phase does not only include an experiment performing part, it also include a analyse phase that draws a conclusion.
The third phase in \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} does not only include testing, but also to draw a conclusion of the result.
In this thesis the conclusion part was not being a part of the testing and the result of it. 
Therefore the third phase has been split into two different parts, which can be seen in \cref{fig:methodOverview} that present the method framework for this thesis.

In the fourth and last phase of framework by S. Robinson et al. \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} the project is being and reviewed.
