\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:methodEvaluation}
The tests was evaluated by measure the accuracy of the yield back groups when the device is being positioned by the system.
As described in \cref{sec:methodTestLayout} a set of points was tested.
If the result is the same as the current group the device is located and the position is a success.
If the resulting group does not correspond with the current group the positioning is not a success.
To give a better result each point in each of the three groups has been tested three times.
These results are then being compared with each other to give a group accuracy as well as a total accuracy of the system.

\bigskip

The resulting positions are also plotted to show at which group the tested points are being located to.
