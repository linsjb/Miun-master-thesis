\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:methodEvaluation}
In the method framework presented by S. Ribonson et al. in \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} the third phase does not only include an experiment performing part, it also include a analyse phase that draws a conclusion.
Their method framework does however consists of four phases, but the last phase is not included in this thesis.
Instead the third phase has been split in two parts, first the experiments and then the conclusion, as seen in \Cref{fig:methodOverview}
