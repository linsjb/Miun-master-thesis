\section{Software implementation}\label{sec:methodSoftwareImplementation}
S. Robinson et al. mentions in \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} how to build a model in a good way.
They also mentions that the best approach is to perform the implementation in small iterative steps where the model is being broken down into smaller parts.
This describes a Agile work method which is proved to work well in software projects as xx describes in...
With the knowledge gathered in \cref{sec:methodProblemDefinition} a backlog with the require software parts could be set up and worked through in this Agile way.
