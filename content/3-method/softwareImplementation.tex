\section{Software implementation}\label{sec:methodSoftwareImplementation}
S. Robinson et al. mentions in \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} how to build a model in a good way.
They also mentions that the best approach is to perform the implementation in small iterative steps where the model is being broken down into smaller parts.
This describes a Agile work method which is proved to work well in software projects as xx describes in...

Together with the software design in \cref{sec:methodSoftwareDesign} an implementation was made to fulfil goal \ref{goal:poc} in \cref{sec:introGoals}.
With the knowledge gathered in \cref{sec:methodProblemDefinition} a backlog with the require software parts could be set up and worked through with an Agile workflow.

\bigskip

The implementation is being presented at its whole in \cref{sec:implementation} below.
