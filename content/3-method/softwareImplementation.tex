\section{Software implementation}\label{sec:methodSoftwareImplementation}
The Agile method is often used in software project, and has been proved with huge success. \cite{DoesAgileWork2015}

\bigskip

In the implementation of the \acrshort{poc} software in this project the work has been conducted with an Agile approach. 
The Agile method was used because of the high flexibility in the priority structure.
If something needed to change it was just to re-prioritise the backlog.
This makes the project easy to manage but also to follow its progress.
This backlog was built with the gathered knowledge described in  \cref{sec:methodProblemDefinition}.
The implementation is being described in \cref{impl}.
