\section{Software tests}\label{sec:methodSoftwareTests}
The third phase in the framework by S. Ribonson et al. in \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} is the experimentation.
Here the experiments is first and foremost executed.
S. Robinson et al. mention previous issues when performing various model experiments.
The first problem is the warm-up period, where it's important that the model is realistic.
Often models does not start in a realistic state and need a warm-up period before data is being monitored and collected.
The second problem is to take a decision how long a model should run and the third problem is to decide how many replications to perform of the experiment.
In the last part of the third phase comes the analysing of the result and a conclusion.
