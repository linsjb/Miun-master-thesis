\section{Software tests}\label{sec:methodSoftwareTests}
The third phase in the framework by S. Ribonson et al. in \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} is the experimentation.
Here the experiments is first and foremost executed and then being reviewed.
S. Robinson et al. mention previous issues when performing various model experiments and mean that it's important to think about how the tests should be performed.
This also applies to a project of this kind.

\bigskip

In this thesis project the experimentation phase from S. Ribonson et al. can be translated into software tests, which can be seen in \cref{fig:methodOverview}.
Sometimes the tests might show that the software need some changes before it can be conducted at full power or give the right result.
In these cases the tests leads back to the software implementation to correct or change the software.
After this new tests is being carried out.

\bigskip

In the first part of testing a test design was developed where the number of beacons and the placement of those where decided.
After that test parameters was decided.


\subsection{Hardware}\label{sec:methodTestHardware}
The beacons used in the test was the RadBeacon Dot by Radius Networks \cite{RadBeaconDotDatasheet}.
Specification of these beacons can be seen in \cref{tab:radbeaconSpecs} below.

\texTable{RadBeacon Dot specification \cite{RadBeaconDotDatasheet}}{radbeaconSpecs}{radbeacon}

\subsection{Test layout}\label{sec:methodTestLayout}
The beacons was arranged in two rows where the first row of four beacons was places 4 meters apart,  and the second row with three beacons was spaced 5 meters apart.
The two rows was spaced 6 meters apart.


\bigskip

Three areas was set to be tested where each of the areas had nine points each to be mapped.
Te blue and yellow area was 3 meters by 2.5 meters and the brown areas was 3 meters by 3 meters.
\Cref{fig:testSetup} presents the test setup with the placement of the iBeacons as well as the three areas.
The black dots in each group was the points to be mapped in each group.

\subsection{Test parameters}\label{sec:methodTestParameters}
The following parameters was set to be tested;

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of mapped fingerprints per location point
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 1 scan per point
	\item 4 scans per point
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
