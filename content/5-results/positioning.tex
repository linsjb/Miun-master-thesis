\section{Positioning}\label{sec:resultPos}
In this section the results from the positioning tests is being presented.
The test is conducted in two steps and the condition for these are being explained in \cref{sec:methodSoftwareTests}.

\bigskip

When testing to position the device each point in each group was being positioned three times.
In \Cref{fig:twoVsFour} the accuracy result from the positioning test is being presented, as well as the total accuracy for the testing with one and four fingerprints per point.

\fig{Total accuracy per group for one and four mappings}{twoVsFour}{0.7}{results/twoVsFour}

When the three groups were mapped with four fingerprints instead of one the accuracy is getting higher in all groups, accept the yellow one, as seen in \Cref{fig:twoVsFour}.
The overall prediction with one mapping for each point is $55\%$ correct and for four mappings it's $75\%$ correct.


\subsection{One fingerprint measurement}\label{sec:resultsPosOneFingerprint}
The positioning result for one fingerprint per point in each group is being presented in this sub-section.
Each group has its own name as the correct group to be positioned in.
\Cref{fig:bluePointResult1p} present the result for the blue group, \Cref{fig:yellowPointResult1p} the yellow group and \Cref{fig:brownPointResult1p} for the brown group.
In appendix \ref{appendix:resultingPointsTable1p} \Cref{tab:1pResults} the results is presented in table form.

\fig{Measurement result with one fingerprint per point for brown group}{brownPointResult1p}{0.77}{results/pointsBrown1p}


\subsection{Four fingerprint measurement}\label{sec:resultPosFourFingerprints}
This sub-section present the resulting positions for the points in each of the three groups, where four fingerprints is mapped for each point.
\Cref{fig:bluePointResult4p} is presenting the result for the blue group, \Cref{fig:yellowPointResult4p} for the yellow group and \Cref{fig:brownPointResult4p} for the brown group. 
\Cref{tab:4pResults} in appendix \ref{appendix:resultingPointsTable4p} present the measurements in table form.
