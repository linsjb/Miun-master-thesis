\section{Positioning fingerprint}\label{sec:theoryFingerprint}
Fingerprints is a popular method to use in positioning systems that does not rely on GPS-signals.
These fingerprints are often based on \acrshort{rssi} values collected from the transmitters used in the \acrfull{ips}.
Fingerprint positioning can be used both for indoor and outdoor positioning.
In a \acrshort{ips} WiFi \acrfull{ap} transmitters is the most popular alternative.

Fingerprint based localization is not only used in WiFi based systems but can
also be used with other hardware, such as \acrlong{ble} Beacons (\cref{sec:theoryBleiBeacons}).

A fingerprint positioning system is built up in a two phase process.  An offline
and online phase.\cite{IndoorFingerprintPositioning2017} 


\subsection{Offline phase}\label{sec:theoryFingerprintOffline}
In the offline phase (also called observation phase) the fingerprints are being collected and
mapped to a location in the environment.
The mapped fingerprints are then being stored in a radio map database.
\Cref{fig:fingerprintOfflinePhaseIllustration} shows the flow for collecting the \acrshort{rssi} signals, mapping them to a location and storing them in the database.
% This is often an time consuming part since all positions need to be manually scanned.

\subsection{Online phase}\label{sec:theoryFingerprintOnline} The online phase
is the part where a user is interacting with the stored fingerprints.
A device is collecting \acrshort{rssi} values from nearby senders in real time.
These collected values is then being compared with the fingerprints in the database.
If a match between the real time \acrshort{rssi} values and the radio map occur the location is being yield back and the device can be positioned.
\Cref{fig:fingerprintOnlinePhaseIllustration} show a illustration of the
online phase.
