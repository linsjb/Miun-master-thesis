% Allm√§nt om KNN
\acrfull{knn} is a machine learning classification algorithm...

% KNN inom positionering
Because of the high performance and low cost of \acrshort{knn} it has been
widely used for non GPS positioning, with good results.  \acrshort{knn} is used
to compare a real time fingerprint from the users device with the stored
fingerprints from the radio map database.  The algorithm starts with choosing
the nearest fingerprint neighbours according to a root-mean-square error.  After
this it completes the positioning by calculating the weighted average of the k
fingerprint data.  \cite{IndoorFingerprintPositioning2017}
