\section{Received Signal Strength Indication}\label{sec:theoryRssi}
\acrfull{rssi} is a indication on the signal strength between a sender and receiver.
It's a less complex method than other technologies such as Time of Arrival, Time Difference of Arrival or
Angle of Arrival that require a proper time synchronization between the sender and receiver.
The benefits with \acrshort{rssi} based measurements is that it will reduce the complexity of the signal measurement, and opens up for easier software implementations.
It does also has a high accuracy, low power consumption and a low cost due to the less complex systems required.
Because of these benefits it became a popular choice to use in non GPS-based positioning.

\acrshort{rssi} measurements can be divided into three different categories;

\begin{itemize}
	\item Trilateration
	\item Approximate Perception
	\item Scene Analysis \cite{IndoorFingerprintPositioning2017}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trilateration}\label{sec:theoryRssiTrilateration} Trilateration
is a positioning technique where three or more senders and receivers converts the signals
into spatial distances.  This is used to create radius of circles and where all
the circles intersect with each other is where the device is located.
\cite{IndoorFingerprintPositioning2017} 

\subsection{Approximate Perception}\label{sec:theoryRssiApproxPerception} In
approximate perception the signal from the strongest base station is the
positioning criterion.  This technique has a low positioning accuracy and to
make it more exact researchers has used a cluster of antennas.  This cluster is
then placed at a know location and will improve the
accuracy.\cite{IndoorFingerprintPositioning2017} 

\subsection{Scene Analysis}\label{sec:theoryRssiSceneAnalysis} Scene analysis
is the most used technique for indoor positioning.  It uses fingerprint matching
(\cref{sec:theoryFingerprint}) and does not require any information of where the
base stations is located.  The positioning is done with the signal strength from
multiple base stations at a given reference point.  Together with a fingerprint
data structure the reference point will act as a localization point for the
positioning system.\cite{IndoorFingerprintPositioning2017}

Measurements taken with \acrshort{rssi} values can be used to make signal
fingerprints to build up a radio map database for indoor
localization.\cite{DevelopmentMobileIndoor2017}
