I want to thank my supervisor at Mid Sweden University, Roger Olsson, for the help under this project and for the very clear and good feedback, in both the work and to get a better written report.
This has helped me a lot.

I would also want to thank LKAB and my supervisor at the company, Stefan Karlstr√∂m, to trust in my work and giving me the opportunity to conduct this thesis work at their company. 
They did also provided me with hardware needed to perform the thesis.
