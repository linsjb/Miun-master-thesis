  abstract = {Industrial augmented reality (IAR) is one of the key pillars of the industrial digitalisation concepts, which connects workers with the physical world through overlaying digital information. Augmented reality (AR) market is increasing but still its adoption levels are low in industry. While companies strive to learn and adopt AR, there are chances that they fail in such endeavours due to lack of understanding key challenges and success factors in this space. This study identifies critical success factors and challenges for IAR implementation projects based on field experiments. The broadly used technology, organisation, environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical basis for the study, while 22 experiments were conducted for validation. It is found that, while technological aspects are of importance, organisational issues are more relevant for industry, which has not been reflected to the same extent in the literature.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose an automatic radio map construction system based on crowdsourcing Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) traces, which does not rely on priori knowledge of floor plans and is robust to inaccurate PDR traces. In this system, we propose to process some opportunistic PDR traces, in which users walk through the building, to generate parts of road paths by translating, rotating and scaling the traces based on the opportunistic GPS locations and gate points as landmarks. Then, we further extend the coverage of road paths by processing the PDR traces entirely obtained indoor by compensating the turning errors and merging the PDR traces based on the similarity of WiFi fingerprints. With such procedures, we can accurately generate indoor road paths of a large-scale building and construct the radio map based on these road paths. Our proposed method achieves a median accuracy of 2.8m and mean accuracy of 2.9m for the constructed road paths. By fusing GPS, PDR, and WiFi fingerprinting with the crowdsourcing radio map, we achieve a median positioning accuracy of 2.9m and mean accuracy of 3.4m without site surveying, which significantly outperforms the positioning algorithm by merely fusing GPS and PDR.},

In order to realize the indoor positioning with these communication systems, techniques such as fingerprinting, trilateration, and triangulation have been widely studied. Even though fingerprinting has been chosen as a representative approach in many literatures, it is known as tedious and time consuming method due to the long-time location learning phase. Therefore, the fingerprinting is expected to be integrated with other methods to enhance the location accuracy and reduce the location estimation procedures. In this work, we discuss one of these methods used for indoor positioning, i.e., weighted centroid localization (WCL) using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) observed from neighboring BLE beacons. The WCL is evaluated in our testbed building and analyzed to configure its parameters for indoor positioning.},

However, IPS is also a challenging topic that has a number of stringent requirements, such as cost, energy efficiency, availability and accuracy. The development of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) iBeacon has opened great opportunities for researchers to solve those challenges. In this paper, we present our iBeacon based positioning system, which we built as an application running on iOS platform. We also present Fingerprinting - the main positioning technique used in our system, in which we configure its fingerprints to improve accuracy. With that, a machine learning algorithm called k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) is applied to extract the most probable user location. In addition, we also use Kalman Filter in order to enhance the stability of iBeacon's signal. Our system results in a 60\% - 71.4\% accuracy rate and an error of up to 1.6 m, which is acceptable in IPS.},

Indoor positioning using WiFi has limits on location placement. To overcome these shortcomings are used sensor beacon bluetooth low energy with the advantages of having low power consumption and relatively small dimensions that can be placed in various places that are difficult to reach by WiFi. Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is a system for knowing the position of objects or people in a room by using radio waves, magnetic fields, or other sensors obtained by mobile devices. The indoor positioning method is divided into deterministic and probabilistic. Deterministic can determine the position faster by using measurement techniques such as Trilateration and Triangulation. Trilateration is a method for determining location with known three location information and device distance to each access point. This research used Trilateration method with measurement technique based on RSSI value. Based on the results of the test, RSSI of the beacon is strongly affected by objects that have thickness and density. In line of sight conditions, Android devices are able to receive signals properly and determine the location of the device using trilateration with quite accurate.},

  abstract = {A guidance and information service for a University library based on Wi-Fi signals using fingerprinting as chosen localization method is under development at TU Wien. After a thorough survey of suitable location technologies for the application it was decided to employ mainly Wi-Fi for localization. For that purpose, the availability, performance, and usability of Wi-Fi in selected areas of the library are analyzed in a first step. These tasks include the measurement of Wi-Fi received signal strengths (RSS) of the visible access points (APs) in different areas. The measurements were carried out in different modes, such as static, kinematic and in stop-and-go mode, with six different smartphones. A dependence on the positioning and tracking modes is seen in the tests. Kinematic measurements pose much greater challenges and depend significantly on the duration of a single Wi-Fi scan. For the smartphones, the scan durations differed in the range of 2.4 to 4.1 s resulting in different accuracies for kinematic positioning, as fewer measurements along the trajectories are available for a device with longer scan duration. The investigations indicated also that the achievable localization performance is only on the few meter level due to the small number of APs of the University own Wi-Fi network deployed in the library. A promising solution for performance improvement is the foreseen usage of low-cost Raspberry Pi units serving as Wi-Fi transmitter and receiver.},

  abstract = {The Agile project management methodology has been widely used in recent years as a means to counter the dangers of traditional, front-end planning methods that often lead to downstream development pathologies. Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) systems in last few years show great potentialities in the manufacturing context: recent pilot projects were developed for supporting quicker product and process design, as well as control and maintenance activities. The high technological complexity together with the wide variety of AR devices require a high technological skill; on the other hand, evaluating their actual impacts on the manufacturing process is still an open question. Few recent studies have analysed this topic by using qualitative approaches based on an “ex post” analysis – i.e. after the design and/or the adoption of the AR system - for evaluating the effectiveness of a developed AR application. The paper proposes an expert based tool for supporting production managers and researchers in effectively evaluating a preliminary ex-ante feasibility analysis for assessing quantitatively most efficient single AR devices (or combinations) to be applied in specific manufacturing processes. A multi-criteria model based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has been proposed to provide decision makers with quantitative knowledge for more efficiently designing AR applications in manufacturing. The model allows to integrate, in the same decision support tool, technical knowledge regarding AR devices with critical process features characterizing manufacturing processes, thus allowing to assess the contribution of the AR device in a wider prospective compared to current technological analyses. A test case study about the evaluation of AR system in on-site maintenance service is also discussed aiming to validate the model, and to outline its global applicability and potentialities. Obtained results highlighted the full efficacy of the proposed model in supporting ex-ante feasibility studies.},

  abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a key technology for the development of smart manufacturing. One of the main advantages of AR is that it can help workers to accomplish several tasks, making it possible the shift from mass production to mass customization. However, it is still not clear how these promises can be fulfilled in an industrial scenario. In particular, the question about which display solutions fit better the industrial constraints remains open. Based on the literature overview, laboratory experiments, and feedbacks from industrial companies, we supported the use of spatial augmented reality (SAR), designing a prototype intended to be used for manual working stations of the future smart factories. This work presents the evaluation of the effectiveness of conveying technical instructions with this SAR prototype as compared to paper manual. We run a within-subjects experiment with 16 participants to measure user task performance (completion times and error rates) and to collect subjective evaluation. We projected technical information on a motorbike engine during a seven-task maintenance procedure. Our results proved that SAR technology improves the operators’ performance with respect to a paper manual and that users well accept it. We found that SAR is more effective for difficult tasks than for simple ones and that the main advantage of SAR is related more to the reduction of error rates than to completion times. These results confirm the goodness of our design choices; then our prototype can be a valid candidate solution for a smart manufacturing application.},

Forty expert technicians were randomly assigned to four training groups in an electronic actuator assembly task: VR (training with the VR platform twice), Control-VR (watching a filmed demonstration twice), AR (training with the AR platform once), and Control-AR (training with the real actuator and the aid of a filmed demonstration once). A post-training test evaluated performance in the real task. Results demonstrate that, in general, the VR and AR training groups required longer training time compared to the Control-VR and Control-AR groups, respectively. There were fewer unsolved errors in the AR group compared to the Control-AR group, and no significant differences in final performance between the VR and Control-VR groups, probably due to a ceiling effect created by the use of two training trials in the selected task for participants who were expert technicians. The results suggest that use of the AR platform for training IMA tasks should be encouraged and use of the VR platform for that purpose should be further evaluated.},

  abstract = {Despite diligent efforts made by the software engineering community, the failure of software projects keeps increasing at an alarming rate. After two decades of this problem reoccurring, one of the leading causes for the high failure rate is still poor process modeling (requirements’ specification). Therefore both researchers and practitioners recognize the importance of business process modeling in understanding and designing accurate software systems. However, lack of direct model checking (verification) feature is one of the main shortcomings in conventional process modeling methods. It is important that models provide verifiable insight into underlying business processes in order to design complex software systems such as Enterprise Information Systems (EIS). The software engineering community has been deploying the same methods that have haunted the industry with failure. In this paper, we try to remedy this issue by looking at a non-conventional framework. We introduce a business process modeling method that is amenable to automatic analysis (simulation), yet powerful enough to capture the rich reality of business systems as enacted in the behavior and interactions of users. The proposed method is based on the innovative language-action perspective.},

The growth of smartphone usage nowadays has fostered a new and popular mobile payment environment. Most of the current generation smartphones support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to communicate with nearby BLE-enabled devices. It is plausible to construct an Over-the-Air BLE-based mobile payment system as one of the payment methods for people living in modern societies. In this paper, a secure indoor positioning-based mobile payment authentication protocol with BLE technology and the corresponding mobile payment system design are proposed. The proposed protocol consists of three phases: initialization phase, session key construction phase, and authentication phase. When a customer moves toward the POS counter area, the proposed mobile payment system will automatically detect the position of the customer to confirm whether the customer is ready for the checkout process. Once the system has identified the customer is standing within the payment-enabled area, the payment system will invoke authentication process between POS and the customer's smartphone through BLE communication channel to generate a secure session key and establish an authenticated communication session to perform the payment transaction accordingly. A prototype is implemented to assess the performance of the proposed design for mobile payment system. In addition, security analysis is conducted to evaluate the security strength of the proposed protocol.},

  abstract = {Problem statement: Location knowledge in indoor environment using Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) has become very useful and popular in recent years. A number of Location Based Services (LBS) have been developed, which are based on IPS, these LBS include asset tracking, inventory management and security based applications. Many next-generation LBS applications such as social networking, local search, advertising and geo-tagging are expected to be used in urban and indoor environments where GNSS either underperforms in terms of fix times or accuracy, or fails altogether. To develop an IPS based on Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which should use already available Wi-Fi infrastructure in a heterogeneous environment. Approach: This study discussed the use of ANN for IPS using RSS in an indoor wireless facility which has varying human activity, material of walls and type of Wireless Access Points (WAP), hence simulating a heterogeneous environment. The proposed system used backpropogation method with 4 input neurons, 2 output neurons and 4 hidden layers. The model was trained with three different types of training data. The accuracy assessment for each training data was performed by computing the distance error and average distance error. Results: The results of the experiments showed that using ANN with the proposed method of collecting training data, maximum accuracy of 0.7 m can be achieved, with 30\% of the distance error less than 1 m and 60\% of the distance error within the range of 1-2 m. Whereas maximum accuracy of 1.01 can be achieved with the commonly used method of collecting training data. The proposed model also showed 67\% more accuracy as compared to a probabilistic model. Conclusion: The results indicated that ANN based IPS can provide accuracy and precision which is quite adequate for the development of indoor LBS while using the already available Wi-Fi infrastructure, also the proposed method for collecting the training data can help in addressing the noise and interference, which are one of the major factors affecting the accuracy of IPS.},

The recent introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio protocol provides new opportunities for indoor location. It supports portable battery-powered beacons that can be easily distributed at low cost, giving it distinct advantages over WiFi. However, its differing use of the radio band brings new challenges too. In this work, we provide a detailed study of BLE fingerprinting using 19 beacons distributed around a 600 m2 testbed to position a consumer device. We demonstrate the high susceptibility of BLE to fast fading, show how to mitigate this, and quantify the true power cost of continuous BLE scanning. We further investigate the choice of key parameters in a BLE positioning system, including beacon density, transmit power, and transmit frequency. We also provide quantitative comparison with WiFi fingerprinting. Our results show advantages to the use of BLE beacons for positioning. For one-shot (push-to-fix) positioning we achieve {$<$}; 2.6 m error 95\% of the time for a dense BLE network (1 beacon per 30 m2), compared to {$<$}; 4.8 m for a reduced density (1 beacon per 100 m2) and {$<$}; 8.5 m for an established WiFi network in the same area.},

Location fingerprinting is a two-phase process. First, a radio map of observed signal strength (SS) values from different locations is recorded during an offline calibration phase. Then, in real time, SS values observed at a users mobile device are compared to the radio map values using proximity-matching algorithms in order to infer current user locations. We present Locus, a software-only, platform-independent tool for location fingerprinting on 802.11 WLANs. Locus has an object-oriented design, and is implemented in Java with graphical display in scalable vector graphics (SVG). While several proximity-matching algorithms have been proposed, very little research has evaluated their performance on existing wireless networks. Using Locus as a framework, we compared the performance of two proposed proximity-matching algorithms experimentally and also quantified the variance of observed SS values on five mobile devices. We find that, in practice, due to issues such as access point occlusion from certain locations, in-building interference effects on signal strengths, calibration and signal strength detection difficulties on certain mobile platforms, the behavior of proximity-matching algorithms can be mobile platform and wireless network dependent, and cannot always be generalized.},

Thus, location awareness and user tracking in indoor wireless networks has become an increasingly important issue. To address the issue, we have developed LOCATOR, a radio frequency based system for location estimation of users in indoor wireless networks. Our system works by building a radio map of the network site, which involves taking signal strength samples at various points in the wireless network, and then using this radio map, the system estimates the user’s current location from the value of his current observed signal strength. Although the use of an RF-based technique for location estimation is not new, but LOCATOR is unique in the way it builds and manages the radio map to process location queries. Moreover, in addition to using ideas of probability to model the problem, we have devised a multi-level clustering based algorithm that work in conjunction with an interpolation scheme for a more efficient and accurate location estimation. We have tested our system on 802.11b wireless network testbeds and have been able to achieve an accuracy of location estimation to within 4 feet of the actual user location with 90\% probability.},

Our key observation is that certain locations in an indoor environment present identifiable signatures on one or more sensing dimensions. An elevator, for instance, imposes a distinct pattern on a smartphone's accelerometer; a corridor-corner may overhear a unique set of WiFi access points; a specific spot may experience an unusual magnetic fluctuation. We hypothesize that these kind of signatures naturally exist in the environment, and can be envisioned as internal landmarks of a building. Mobile devices that "sense" these landmarks can recalibrate their locations, while dead-reckoning schemes can track them between landmarks. Results from 3 different indoor settings, including a shopping mall, demonstrate median location errors of 1:69m. War-driving is not necessary, neither are floorplans the system simultaneously computes the locations of users and landmarks, in a manner that they converge reasonably quickly. We believe this is an unconventional approach to indoor localization, holding promise for real-world deployment.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in the fields of smartphones and wireless communication technologies such as beacons, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband have made it possible to realize indoor positioning system (IPS) with a few meters of accuracy. In this paper, an improvement over traditional fingerprinting localization is proposed by combining it with weighted centroid localization (WCL). The proposed localization method reduces the total number of fingerprint reference points over the localization space, thus minimizing both the time required for reading radio frequency signals and the number of reference points needed during the fingerprinting learning process, which eventually makes the process less time-consuming. The proposed positioning has two major steps of operation. In the first step, we have realized fingerprinting that utilizes lightly populated reference points (RPs) and WCL individually. Using the location estimated at the first step, WCL is run again for the final location estimation. The proposed localization technique reduces the number of required fingerprint RPs by more than 40\% compared to normal fingerprinting localization method with a similar localization estimation error.},

We describe in this paper, our implementation for DEBS 2019 Grand Challenge for an object recognition system from high-speed LiDAR data stream. Our system includes a data processing pipeline with 3 main stages, 1. LiDAR data filtering 2. Object segmentation and noise reduction 3. Multi-class object classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our evaluation shows that we can classify objects with high accuracy using the point cloud data and neural network. However, we observed that the classification may fail if the object segmentation is not separating objects correctly in different segments especially when the objects are largely covering each other. We proposed a pre-processing approach for object segmentation based on separating LiDAR data into multiple area sectors before segmenting the objects.},

  abstract = {One of the barriers that prevent augmented reality (AR) from being widely adopted in diverse and complex industrial operations is the lack of adaptive and scalable AR work instruction (ARWI). This paper suggests a systematic method to solve the problem. The proposed method presents an adaptive representation structure that expresses and controls those interrelated aspects of ARWI adaptiveness: authoring, environment, guiding and process control. The proposed method also provides a detailed approach to achieve the adaptiveness of ARWI in its authoring and running process. The ARWI design workflow suggested can incorporate industrial AR elements via on-site operators’ inputs without programming instead of developers or engineers. At the same time, the adaptive ARWI can adapt to different people, environment objects, and processes of complex industrial operations at runtime. This advantage brings ARWI design closer to real applications and makes the technology more adoptable. Three user studies, using the disassembly operations of an aircraft engine’s hydraulic actuator and other two practical cases, are used to assess the proposed method and support our claims.},

During an offline phase, fingerprints are collected at known positions in the building. This database of locations and the associated fingerprints are called the radio map. In the online mode, the current Wi-Fi fingerprint probability distributions are compared with those of the radio map. The user location is estimated by calculating a weighted average of the three offline positions that best match the online measurements. Experiments show that our technique is superior to other proposed methods and reaches a median error of 2.4m.},

In particular, wireless fingerprinting localization has received much attention due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing hardware. In this work, we take a closer look at the underlying aspects of wireless fingerprinting localization. First, we review the various methods to create a radiomap. In particular, we look at the traditional fingerprinting method which is based purely on measurements, the parametric pathloss regression model and the non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. Then, based on these three methods and measurements from a real world deployment, the various aspects such as the density of access points (APs) and impact of an outdated signature map which affect the performance of fingerprinting localization are examined. At the end of the paper, the audiences should have a better understanding of what to expect from fingerprinting localization in a real world deployment.},
