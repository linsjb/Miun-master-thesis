  abstract = {In this work, we propose an automatic radio map construction system based on crowdsourcing Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) traces, which does not rely on priori knowledge of floor plans and is robust to inaccurate PDR traces. In this system, we propose to process some opportunistic PDR traces, in which users walk through the building, to generate parts of road paths by translating, rotating and scaling the traces based on the opportunistic GPS locations and gate points as landmarks. Then, we further extend the coverage of road paths by processing the PDR traces entirely obtained indoor by compensating the turning errors and merging the PDR traces based on the similarity of WiFi fingerprints. With such procedures, we can accurately generate indoor road paths of a large-scale building and construct the radio map based on these road paths. Our proposed method achieves a median accuracy of 2.8m and mean accuracy of 2.9m for the constructed road paths. By fusing GPS, PDR, and WiFi fingerprinting with the crowdsourcing radio map, we achieve a median positioning accuracy of 2.9m and mean accuracy of 3.4m without site surveying, which significantly outperforms the positioning algorithm by merely fusing GPS and PDR.},

In order to realize the indoor positioning with these communication systems, techniques such as fingerprinting, trilateration, and triangulation have been widely studied. Even though fingerprinting has been chosen as a representative approach in many literatures, it is known as tedious and time consuming method due to the long-time location learning phase. Therefore, the fingerprinting is expected to be integrated with other methods to enhance the location accuracy and reduce the location estimation procedures. In this work, we discuss one of these methods used for indoor positioning, i.e., weighted centroid localization (WCL) using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) observed from neighboring BLE beacons. The WCL is evaluated in our testbed building and analyzed to configure its parameters for indoor positioning.},

The development of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) iBeacon has opened great opportunities for researchers to solve those challenges. In this paper, we present our iBeacon based positioning system, which we built as an application running on iOS platform. We also present Fingerprinting - the main positioning technique used in our system, in which we configure its fingerprints to improve accuracy. With that, a machine learning algorithm called k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) is applied to extract the most probable user location. In addition, we also use Kalman Filter in order to enhance the stability of iBeacon's signal. Our system results in a 60\% - 71.4\% accuracy rate and an error of up to 1.6 m, which is acceptable in IPS.},

Indoor positioning using WiFi has limits on location placement. To overcome these shortcomings are used sensor beacon bluetooth low energy with the advantages of having low power consumption and relatively small dimensions that can be placed in various places that are difficult to reach by WiFi. Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is a system for knowing the position of objects or people in a room by using radio waves, magnetic fields, or other sensors obtained by mobile devices. The indoor positioning method is divided into deterministic and probabilistic. Deterministic can determine the position faster by using measurement techniques such as Trilateration and Triangulation. Trilateration is a method for determining location with known three location information and device distance to each access point. This research used Trilateration method with measurement technique based on RSSI value. Based on the results of the test, RSSI of the beacon is strongly affected by objects that have thickness and density. In line of sight conditions, Android devices are able to receive signals properly and determine the location of the device using trilateration with quite accurate.},

  abstract = {A guidance and information service for a University library based on Wi-Fi signals using fingerprinting as chosen localization method is under development at TU Wien. After a thorough survey of suitable location technologies for the application it was decided to employ mainly Wi-Fi for localization. For that purpose, the availability, performance, and usability of Wi-Fi in selected areas of the library are analyzed in a first step. These tasks include the measurement of Wi-Fi received signal strengths (RSS) of the visible access points (APs) in different areas. The measurements were carried out in different modes, such as static, kinematic and in stop-and-go mode, with six different smartphones. A dependence on the positioning and tracking modes is seen in the tests. Kinematic measurements pose much greater challenges and depend significantly on the duration of a single Wi-Fi scan. For the smartphones, the scan durations differed in the range of 2.4 to 4.1 s resulting in different accuracies for kinematic positioning, as fewer measurements along the trajectories are available for a device with longer scan duration. The investigations indicated also that the achievable localization performance is only on the few meter level due to the small number of APs of the University own Wi-Fi network deployed in the library. A promising solution for performance improvement is the foreseen usage of low-cost Raspberry Pi units serving as Wi-Fi transmitter and receiver.},

  abstract = {The Agile project management methodology has been widely used in recent years as a means to counter the dangers of traditional, front-end planning methods that often lead to downstream development pathologies. Although numerous authors have pointed to the advantages of Agile, with its emphasis on individuals and interactions over processes, customer collaboration over contracts and formal negotiations, and responsiveness over rigid planning, there are, to date, very few large-scale, empirical studies to support the contention that Agile methods can improve the likelihood of project success. Developed originally for software development, it is still predominantly an IT phenomenon. But due to its success it has now spread to non-IT projects. Using a data sample of 1002 projects across multiple industries and countries, we tested the effect of Agile use in organizations on two dimensions of project success: efficiency and overall stakeholder satisfaction against organizational goals. We further examined the moderating effects of variables such as perceived quality of the vision/goals of the project, project complexity, and project team experience. Our findings suggest that Agile methods do have a positive impact on both dimensions of project success. Further, the quality of the vision/goals is a marginally significant moderator of this effect. Implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed.},

After two decades of this problem reoccurring, one of the leading causes for the high failure rate is still poor process modeling (requirementsâ specification). Therefore both researchers and practitioners recognize the importance of business process modeling in understanding and designing accurate software systems. However, lack of direct model checking (verification) feature is one of the main shortcomings in conventional process modeling methods. It is important that models provide verifiable insight into underlying business processes in order to design complex software systems such as Enterprise Information Systems (EIS). The software engineering community has been deploying the same methods that have haunted the industry with failure. In this paper, we try to remedy this issue by looking at a non-conventional framework. We introduce a business process modeling method that is amenable to automatic analysis (simulation), yet powerful enough to capture the rich reality of business systems as enacted in the behavior and interactions of users. The proposed method is based on the innovative language-action perspective.},

The growth of smartphone usage nowadays has fostered a new and popular mobile payment environment. Most of the current generation smartphones support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to communicate with nearby BLE-enabled devices. It is plausible to construct an Over-the-Air BLE-based mobile payment system as one of the payment methods for people living in modern societies. In this paper, a secure indoor positioning-based mobile payment authentication protocol with BLE technology and the corresponding mobile payment system design are proposed. The proposed protocol consists of three phases: initialization phase, session key construction phase, and authentication phase. When a customer moves toward the POS counter area, the proposed mobile payment system will automatically detect the position of the customer to confirm whether the customer is ready for the checkout process. Once the system has identified the customer is standing within the payment-enabled area, the payment system will invoke authentication process between POS and the customer's smartphone through BLE communication channel to generate a secure session key and establish an authenticated communication session to perform the payment transaction accordingly. A prototype is implemented to assess the performance of the proposed design for mobile payment system. In addition, security analysis is conducted to evaluate the security strength of the proposed protocol.},

  abstract = {Problem statement: Location knowledge in indoor environment using Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) has become very useful and popular in recent years. A number of Location Based Services (LBS) have been developed, which are based on IPS, these LBS include asset tracking, inventory management and security based applications. Many next-generation LBS applications such as social networking, local search, advertising and geo-tagging are expected to be used in urban and indoor environments where GNSS either underperforms in terms of fix times or accuracy, or fails altogether. To develop an IPS based on Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which should use already available Wi-Fi infrastructure in a heterogeneous environment. Approach: This study discussed the use of ANN for IPS using RSS in an indoor wireless facility which has varying human activity, material of walls and type of Wireless Access Points (WAP), hence simulating a heterogeneous environment. The proposed system used backpropogation method with 4 input neurons, 2 output neurons and 4 hidden layers. The model was trained with three different types of training data. The accuracy assessment for each training data was performed by computing the distance error and average distance error. Results: The results of the experiments showed that using ANN with the proposed method of collecting training data, maximum accuracy of 0.7 m can be achieved, with 30\% of the distance error less than 1 m and 60\% of the distance error within the range of 1-2 m. Whereas maximum accuracy of 1.01 can be achieved with the commonly used method of collecting training data. The proposed model also showed 67\% more accuracy as compared to a probabilistic model. Conclusion: The results indicated that ANN based IPS can provide accuracy and precision which is quite adequate for the development of indoor LBS while using the already available Wi-Fi infrastructure, also the proposed method for collecting the training data can help in addressing the noise and interference, which are one of the major factors affecting the accuracy of IPS.},

  abstract = {The complexity of indoor radio propagation has resulted in location-awareness being derived from empirical fingerprinting techniques, where positioning is performed via a previously-constructed radio map, usually of WiFi signals. The recent introduction of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) radio protocol provides new opportunities for indoor location. It supports portable battery-powered beacons that can be easily distributed at low cost, giving it distinct advantages over WiFi. However, its differing use of the radio band brings new challenges too. In this work, we provide a detailed study of BLE fingerprinting using 19 beacons distributed around a 600 m2 testbed to position a consumer device. We demonstrate the high susceptibility of BLE to fast fading, show how to mitigate this, and quantify the true power cost of continuous BLE scanning. We further investigate the choice of key parameters in a BLE positioning system, including beacon density, transmit power, and transmit frequency. We also provide quantitative comparison with WiFi fingerprinting. Our results show advantages to the use of BLE beacons for positioning. For one-shot (push-to-fix) positioning we achieve {$<$}; 2.6 m error 95\% of the time for a dense BLE network (1 beacon per 30 m2), compared to {$<$}; 4.8 m for a reduced density (1 beacon per 100 m2) and {$<$}; 8.5 m for an established WiFi network in the same area.},

Location fingerprinting is a two-phase process. First, a radio map of observed signal strength (SS) values from different locations is recorded during an offline calibration phase. Then, in real time, SS values observed at a users mobile device are compared to the radio map values using proximity-matching algorithms in order to infer current user locations. We present Locus, a software-only, platform-independent tool for location fingerprinting on 802.11 WLANs. Locus has an object-oriented design, and is implemented in Java with graphical display in scalable vector graphics (SVG). While several proximity-matching algorithms have been proposed, very little research has evaluated their performance on existing wireless networks. Using Locus as a framework, we compared the performance of two proposed proximity-matching algorithms experimentally and also quantified the variance of observed SS values on five mobile devices. We find that, in practice, due to issues such as access point occlusion from certain locations, in-building interference effects on signal strengths, calibration and signal strength detection difficulties on certain mobile platforms, the behavior of proximity-matching algorithms can be mobile platform and wireless network dependent, and cannot always be generalized.},

Thus, location awareness and user tracking in indoor wireless networks has become an increasingly important issue. To address the issue, we have developed LOCATOR, a radio frequency based system for location estimation of users in indoor wireless networks. Our system works by building a radio map of the network site, which involves taking signal strength samples at various points in the wireless network, and then using this radio map, the system estimates the userâs current location from the value of his current observed signal strength. Although the use of an RF-based technique for location estimation is not new, but LOCATOR is unique in the way it builds and manages the radio map to process location queries. Moreover, in addition to using ideas of probability to model the problem, we have devised a multi-level clustering based algorithm that work in conjunction with an interpolation scheme for a more efficient and accurate location estimation. We have tested our system on 802.11b wireless network testbeds and have been able to achieve an accuracy of location estimation to within 4 feet of the actual user location with 90\% probability.},

We develop the framework for analyzing a simple positioning system that employs the Euclidean distance between a sample signal vector and the location fingerprints of an area stored in a database. We analyze the effect of the number of access points that are visible and radio propagation parameters on the performance of the positioning system and provide some preliminary guidelines on its design.},

Our key observation is that certain locations in an indoor environment present identifiable signatures on one or more sensing dimensions. An elevator, for instance, imposes a distinct pattern on a smartphone's accelerometer; a corridor-corner may overhear a unique set of WiFi access points; a specific spot may experience an unusual magnetic fluctuation. We hypothesize that these kind of signatures naturally exist in the environment, and can be envisioned as internal landmarks of a building. Mobile devices that "sense" these landmarks can recalibrate their locations, while dead-reckoning schemes can track them between landmarks. Results from 3 different indoor settings, including a shopping mall, demonstrate median location errors of 1:69m. War-driving is not necessary, neither are floorplans the system simultaneously computes the locations of users and landmarks, in a manner that they converge reasonably quickly. We believe this is an unconventional approach to indoor localization, holding promise for real-world deployment.},

Location estimation of sensor nodes is still a crucial area of research because of new localization requirements. One of the main hurdles facing sensor localization in WSNs is accuracy. Many localization algorithms and techniques have been proposed to estimate the position of nodes. In this paper, we consider an RSSI (received signal strength indicator) range based localization algorithm that relies on measuring the received signal strength indicator for distance estimation. In this work, we conducted the experiments in outdoor and indoor environments to derive the path loss model. The result shows that the outdoor environment has the better distance estimation than an indoor environment. Hence we investigate the effect of varying the anchor node density on localization error with minimum number of anchor nodes thereby enhancing an accuracy of the network.},

In this paper, an improvement over traditional fingerprinting localization is proposed by combining it with weighted centroid localization (WCL). The proposed localization method reduces the total number of fingerprint reference points over the localization space, thus minimizing both the time required for reading radio frequency signals and the number of reference points needed during the fingerprinting learning process, which eventually makes the process less time-consuming. The proposed positioning has two major steps of operation. In the first step, we have realized fingerprinting that utilizes lightly populated reference points (RPs) and WCL individually. Using the location estimated at the first step, WCL is run again for the final location estimation. The proposed localization technique reduces the number of required fingerprint RPs by more than 40\% compared to normal fingerprinting localization method with a similar localization estimation error.},

  abstract = {High-precision indoor positioning is important for modern society. This paper proposes a way to achieve high positioning accuracy and obtain a trajectory close to the actual path in a common application scenario by smartphone without the use of a complicated algorithm. In the actual positioning process, a stable signal source can reduce the signal interference caused by environments. Bluetooth low energy has its own advantages in indoor positioning because it can be seen as a more stable signal source. In this study, we used smartphones to record the changing Bluetooth signals and used a basic nearest neighbor, weight centroid, and probability-based method, which we called an advanced weighted centroid method, to obtain position coordinates and the motion trajectory during the experiment. We used a weight centroid method based on least squares to solve the overdetermined problem. This can also be used to calculate the initial position of the advanced weight centroid. The advanced weighted centroid method introduced a Gaussian distribution to model the distribution of the signal. Translating a deterministic problem into a fuzzy probability problem aligns more with positioning facts and can achieve better results. Experimental results showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the dynamic positioning result obtained through the probabilistic method was within 1 m and had a more consistent trajectory. Moreover, the impact of the number of iBeacons on the positioning accuracy has been discussed, and a reference for iBeacon placement has been provided. In addition, an experiment was also conducted on the effect of signal transmission frequency on accuracy.},

High-precision indoor localization is critical to many personal and business applications. After Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), an energy-efficient version of Bluetooth, is widely deployed, Bluetooth-based indoor localization turns out to be a practical method to locate Bluetooth-enabled devices due to its low battery cost. In this paper, we present two novel BLE-based localization schemes, Low-precision Indoor Localization (LIL) and High-precision Indoor Localization (HIL). Different than most of the existing localization methods that attempt to find the specific location of the object under investigation, LIL and HIL utilize the collected RSSI measurements to generate a small region in which the object is guaranteed to be found. Compared with LIL, HIL leads to smaller localization regions. However, HIL requires an extra data-training phase.},

In this paper, we propose a novel indoor positioning algorithm based on the received signal strength indication and pedestrian dead reckoning. In order to enhance the accuracy and reliability of our proposed probabilistic position selection algorithm in mixed line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments, a low-complexity identification approach is proposed to identify the change in the channel situation between NLOS and LOS. Numerical experiment results indicate that our proposed algorithm has a higher accuracy and is less impacted by NLOS errors than other conventional methods in mixed LOS and NLOS indoor environments.},

  abstract = {Positioning services are increasingly used for applications such as navigation, advertising and social media. While outdoor navigation based on GPS and/or cellular systems works well, indoor navigation is a much tougher challenge. This paper presents a new indoor positioning method based on Wi-Fi fingerprints, i.e. RSSI measurements from multiple Wi-Fi access points. During an offline phase, fingerprints are collected at known positions in the building. This database of locations and the associated fingerprints are called the radio map. In the online mode, the current Wi-Fi fingerprint probability distributions are compared with those of the radio map. The user location is estimated by calculating a weighted average of the three offline positions that best match the online measurements. Experiments show that our technique is superior to other proposed methods and reaches a median error of 2.4m.},

  abstract = {Localization has attracted a lot of research effort in the last decade due to the explosion of location based service (LBS). In particular, wireless fingerprinting localization has received much attention due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing hardware. In this work, we take a closer look at the underlying aspects of wireless fingerprinting localization. First, we review the various methods to create a radiomap. In particular, we look at the traditional fingerprinting method which is based purely on measurements, the parametric pathloss regression model and the non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. Then, based on these three methods and measurements from a real world deployment, the various aspects such as the density of access points (APs) and impact of an outdated signature map which affect the performance of fingerprinting localization are examined. At the end of the paper, the audiences should have a better understanding of what to expect from fingerprinting localization in a real world deployment.},
