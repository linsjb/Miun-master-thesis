\section{Software implementation}\label{sec:methodSoftwareImplementation}
\mt{In the implementation of the \acrshort{poc} software in this project, the work has been conducted with an Agile approach, because of its high flexibility and success \cite{DoesAgileWork2015}.
Since an Agile approach is mainly used in larger teams and not in one-man projects, only some parts of it have been used.
It has been used as a guidance of how to set up an easy maintained and flexible backlog structure.
This backlog could easily be re-prioritized if something needed to be changed along the implementation.
A result from this is that the project was easy to maintain, but also the ease to see the overall implementation progress.
This backlog was built with the gathered knowledge described in  \cref{sec:methodProblemDefinition}.
The implementation is being described in \cref{impl}.}
