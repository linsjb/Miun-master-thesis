\section{Method framework motivation}\label{sec:methodFramework}
In the literature review presented in \cref{sec:theoryRelatedWork} it was showed that  all papers, which implemented an \acrfull{ips}, has no clear method but was all following the same structure.
They all started with a problem formulation followed by the software design, implementation, testing and finally an evaluation.
\mt{Software project does often use this kind of structure, and since the method was being used in the reviewed papers a similar method structure was used in this thesis project.}
The used method structure is being presented in \Cref{fig:methodOverview}.

\fig{Overview of the used method based on \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995} }{methodOverview}{1}{methodFlow}

A method framework that is well-defined is presented in the paper \textit{Secrets of successful simulation projects} \cite{SecretsSuccessfulSimulation1995}.
The paper describes how a simulation based project should be performed for a successful result.
This thesis project is not a simulation project, but the proposed method framework can still verify that the method structure in this thesis is relevant.
