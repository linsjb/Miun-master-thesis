  abstract = {Industrial augmented reality (IAR) is one of the key pillars of the industrial digitalisation concepts, which connects workers with the physical world through overlaying digital information. Augmented reality (AR) market is increasing but still its adoption levels are low in industry. While companies strive to learn and adopt AR, there are chances that they fail in such endeavours due to lack of understanding key challenges and success factors in this space. This study identifies critical success factors and challenges for IAR implementation projects based on field experiments. The broadly used technology, organisation, environment (TOE) framework was used as a theoretical basis for the study, while 22 experiments were conducted for validation. It is found that, while technological aspects are of importance, organisational issues are more relevant for industry, which has not been reflected to the same extent in the literature.},

  abstract = {In this work, we propose an automatic radio map construction system based on crowdsourcing Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) traces, which does not rely on priori knowledge of floor plans and is robust to inaccurate PDR traces. In this system, we propose to process some opportunistic PDR traces, in which users walk through the building, to generate parts of road paths by translating, rotating and scaling the traces based on the opportunistic GPS locations and gate points as landmarks. Then, we further extend the coverage of road paths by processing the PDR traces entirely obtained indoor by compensating the turning errors and merging the PDR traces based on the similarity of WiFi fingerprints. With such procedures, we can accurately generate indoor road paths of a large-scale building and construct the radio map based on these road paths. Our proposed method achieves a median accuracy of 2.8m and mean accuracy of 2.9m for the constructed road paths. By fusing GPS, PDR, and WiFi fingerprinting with the crowdsourcing radio map, we achieve a median positioning accuracy of 2.9m and mean accuracy of 3.4m without site surveying, which significantly outperforms the positioning algorithm by merely fusing GPS and PDR.},

Indoor positioning using WiFi has limits on location placement. To overcome these shortcomings are used sensor beacon bluetooth low energy with the advantages of having low power consumption and relatively small dimensions that can be placed in various places that are difficult to reach by WiFi. Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is a system for knowing the position of objects or people in a room by using radio waves, magnetic fields, or other sensors obtained by mobile devices. The indoor positioning method is divided into deterministic and probabilistic. Deterministic can determine the position faster by using measurement techniques such as Trilateration and Triangulation. Trilateration is a method for determining location with known three location information and device distance to each access point. This research used Trilateration method with measurement technique based on RSSI value. Based on the results of the test, RSSI of the beacon is strongly affected by objects that have thickness and density. In line of sight conditions, Android devices are able to receive signals properly and determine the location of the device using trilateration with quite accurate.},

  abstract = {A guidance and information service for a University library based on Wi-Fi signals using fingerprinting as chosen localization method is under development at TU Wien. After a thorough survey of suitable location technologies for the application it was decided to employ mainly Wi-Fi for localization. For that purpose, the availability, performance, and usability of Wi-Fi in selected areas of the library are analyzed in a first step. These tasks include the measurement of Wi-Fi received signal strengths (RSS) of the visible access points (APs) in different areas. The measurements were carried out in different modes, such as static, kinematic and in stop-and-go mode, with six different smartphones. A dependence on the positioning and tracking modes is seen in the tests. Kinematic measurements pose much greater challenges and depend significantly on the duration of a single Wi-Fi scan. For the smartphones, the scan durations differed in the range of 2.4 to 4.1 s resulting in different accuracies for kinematic positioning, as fewer measurements along the trajectories are available for a device with longer scan duration. The investigations indicated also that the achievable localization performance is only on the few meter level due to the small number of APs of the University own Wi-Fi network deployed in the library. A promising solution for performance improvement is the foreseen usage of low-cost Raspberry Pi units serving as Wi-Fi transmitter and receiver.},

VR and AR systems are now widely regarded as promising training platforms for complex and highly demanding IMA tasks. However, there is a need to empirically evaluate their efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional training methods. Forty expert technicians were randomly assigned to four training groups in an electronic actuator assembly task: VR (training with the VR platform twice), Control-VR (watching a filmed demonstration twice), AR (training with the AR platform once), and Control-AR (training with the real actuator and the aid of a filmed demonstration once). A post-training test evaluated performance in the real task. Results demonstrate that, in general, the VR and AR training groups required longer training time compared to the Control-VR and Control-AR groups, respectively. There were fewer unsolved errors in the AR group compared to the Control-AR group, and no significant differences in final performance between the VR and Control-VR groups, probably due to a ceiling effect created by the use of two training trials in the selected task for participants who were expert technicians. The results suggest that use of the AR platform for training IMA tasks should be encouraged and use of the VR platform for that purpose should be further evaluated.},

  abstract = {The development of information technology has paved the way for faster and more convenient payment process flows and new methodology for the design and implementation of next generation payment systems. The growth of smartphone usage nowadays has fostered a new and popular mobile payment environment. Most of the current generation smartphones support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to communicate with nearby BLE-enabled devices. It is plausible to construct an Over-the-Air BLE-based mobile payment system as one of the payment methods for people living in modern societies. In this paper, a secure indoor positioning-based mobile payment authentication protocol with BLE technology and the corresponding mobile payment system design are proposed. The proposed protocol consists of three phases: initialization phase, session key construction phase, and authentication phase. When a customer moves toward the POS counter area, the proposed mobile payment system will automatically detect the position of the customer to confirm whether the customer is ready for the checkout process. Once the system has identified the customer is standing within the payment-enabled area, the payment system will invoke authentication process between POS and the customer's smartphone through BLE communication channel to generate a secure session key and establish an authenticated communication session to perform the payment transaction accordingly. A prototype is implemented to assess the performance of the proposed design for mobile payment system. In addition, security analysis is conducted to evaluate the security strength of the proposed protocol.},

  abstract = {With the wide spread growth of mobile computing devices and local area wireless networks, wireless network providers have started to target the users with value-added services based on the users’ location information. Thus, location awareness and user tracking in indoor wireless networks has become an increasingly important issue. To address the issue, we have developed LOCATOR, a radio frequency based system for location estimation of users in indoor wireless networks. Our system works by building a radio map of the network site, which involves taking signal strength samples at various points in the wireless network, and then using this radio map, the system estimates the user’s current location from the value of his current observed signal strength. Although the use of an RF-based technique for location estimation is not new, but LOCATOR is unique in the way it builds and manages the radio map to process location queries. Moreover, in addition to using ideas of probability to model the problem, we have devised a multi-level clustering based algorithm that work in conjunction with an interpolation scheme for a more efficient and accurate location estimation. We have tested our system on 802.11b wireless network testbeds and have been able to achieve an accuracy of location estimation to within 4 feet of the actual user location with 90\% probability.},

In this paper, an improvement over traditional fingerprinting localization is proposed by combining it with weighted centroid localization (WCL). The proposed localization method reduces the total number of fingerprint reference points over the localization space, thus minimizing both the time required for reading radio frequency signals and the number of reference points needed during the fingerprinting learning process, which eventually makes the process less time-consuming. The proposed positioning has two major steps of operation. In the first step, we have realized fingerprinting that utilizes lightly populated reference points (RPs) and WCL individually. Using the location estimated at the first step, WCL is run again for the final location estimation. The proposed localization technique reduces the number of required fingerprint RPs by more than 40\% compared to normal fingerprinting localization method with a similar localization estimation error.},

The proposed method also provides a detailed approach to achieve the adaptiveness of ARWI in its authoring and running process. The ARWI design workflow suggested can incorporate industrial AR elements via on-site operators’ inputs without programming instead of developers or engineers. At the same time, the adaptive ARWI can adapt to different people, environment objects, and processes of complex industrial operations at runtime. This advantage brings ARWI design closer to real applications and makes the technology more adoptable. Three user studies, using the disassembly operations of an aircraft engine’s hydraulic actuator and other two practical cases, are used to assess the proposed method and support our claims.},
